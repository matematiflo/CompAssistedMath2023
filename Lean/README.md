# **Formal proofs in Lean 3 (old version)**

**Author:** Florent Schaffhauser, Uni-Heidelberg, Summer Semester 2023

This is the GitHub repository for the *Introduction to Lean* part of the **(Pro)Seminar on computer-assisted mathematics**, held at the University of Heidelberg in the Summer Semester of 2023.

Below you will find the programme of the seminar. For each week, there is a corresponding `.lean` file, which you can use to practice. You can also view a markdown version of the weekly files by clicking on the corresponding `.md` files.

In order to work on the `.lean` files, several options are available:

* Download the file and open it in your [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) account.
* *Fork* (not just clone) the [Comp_assisted_math](https://github.com/matematiflo/Comp_assisted_math) repository and, *from the forked repository in your own GitHub account*, open a *Codespace*. You will need to install the Lean 3 extension for that Codespace. You can do that directly from the Codespace VS code emulator (Codespaces will suggest using *Elan* to do it, and you should say yes to that). If you use Codespaces from the present repository instead of from your forked copy, you will not be able to save your work without opening a pull request.
* Install *Lean 3* on your computer by following the instructions [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html). Then download the file and open it in VS Code.

Be aware that *Lean 4* is not backwards-compatible with *Lean 3* and that the `.lean` files in this repository will not work in *Lean 4*.
