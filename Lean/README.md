# **Formal proofs in Lean 3**

**Author:** Florent Schaffhauser, Uni-Heidelberg, Summer Semester 2023

This is the GitHub repository for the *Introduction to Lean* part of the **(Pro)Seminar on computer-assisted mathematics**, held at the University of Heidelberg in the Summer Semester of 2023.

Below you will find the programme of the seminar. For each week, there is a corresponding `.lean` file, which you can use to practice. You can also view a markdown version of the weekly files by clicking on the corresponding `.md` files.

In order to work on the `.lean` files, several options are available:

* Download the file and open it in your [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) account. *This is the recommended option to get started.*
* *Fork* (not just clone) the [Comp_assisted_math](https://github.com/matematiflo/Comp_assisted_math) repository and, *from the forked repository in your own GitHub account*, open a *Codespace*. You will need to install the **Lean 3 extension** for that Codespace. You can do that directly from the Codespace VS code emulator (Codespaces will suggest using *Elan* to do it, and you should say yes to that). If you use Codespaces from the present repository instead of from your forked copy, I am not sure whether you will not be able to save your work without opening a pull request. Let me know if you try!
* Install *Lean 3* on your computer by following the instructions [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html). Then download the file and open it in VS Code.

Be aware that *Lean 4* is not backwards-compatible with *Lean 3* and that the `.lean` files in this repository will not work in *Lean 4*.
