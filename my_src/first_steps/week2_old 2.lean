/- # **Functions**

**Author:** Florent Schaffhauser, Uni-Heidelberg, Summer Semester 2023

Our goal in this file is to keep exploring basic definitions and tactics in Lean. It is a direct follow-up to the previous [*Introduction to Lean*](https://github.com/matematiflo/Comp_assisted_math/blob/2023_SoSe/Lean/week1.lean).

The main objective today is to learn about functions:

* How to define basic functions in Lean
* How to *curry* and *uncurry* functions 
* How to define *dependent types* and how to use them

As a matter of fact, we have already seen an important example of a function, in the [*modus ponens* file](https://github.com/matematiflo/Comp_assisted_math/blob/2023_SoSe/Lean/Practice_folder/modus_ponens.lean), where we also learned about the following tactics:

* `exact`
* `apply` 
* `intro`
* `cases`

In what follows, we will encounter new tactics:

* `unfold`
* `rewrite` (also abbreviated `rw`)
* `use`
* `ring` (whose library we will need to import, see below)

Recall that in [week1.lean](https://github.com/matematiflo/Comp_assisted_math/blob/2023_SoSe/Lean/week1.lean), we also learned about the `reflexivity` tactic, usually abbreaviated to `refl`.

We start by importing the `tactic.ring` library, which will be used in this file. The `import` command must be used at the beginning of the .lean file. 

As a consequence of this import, the basic `goals accomplished` message of Lean gets upgraded to the fancy `goals accomplished üéâ` version :-) Check it out in the file below! -/

-- import tactic.ring

/- ## **Defining a function**

There are several ways to define a function in Lean, all of them useful depending on the context.

The basic type-theoretical aspect behind what we are about to see is that, if `X` and `Y` are types, then we can construct terms of type `X ‚Üí Y`, which is the type of functions from `X` to `Y` (the symbol `‚Üí` is called a *constructor*).

We have already seen several types, for instance `‚Ñï` (the type of natural numbers), `‚Ñ§` (the type of integers), but also `Prop`, `char`, `string` or `list ‚Ñï`. A `#check` command on any one of those will reveal that these types are all terms of type `Type` (note the capitalized `T` in `Type` here), which is the type with which we will be working most of the time. Indeed, if `X` and `Y` are terms of type `Type`, then the type `X ‚Üí Y` is also a term of type `Type`, as we shall see in the examples below. -/

/- ### First definition of a function

The basic syntax presented below should be thought of as a precise version of the intuitive notation `f‚ÇÅ(n) := - 2 * n + 5`, which means that `f‚ÇÅ(n)` is *defined* to be equal `- 2 * n + 5`. This is certainly meaningful if we specify that `n` is a term for which the expression `- 2 * n + 5` makes sense, for instance `n : ‚Ñ§`, in which case `- 2 * n + 5` is also a term of type `‚Ñ§`. So this will define a term `f‚ÇÅ : ‚Ñ§ ‚Üí ‚Ñ§`, ¬°.e. a function from `‚Ñ§` to `‚Ñ§`. 

The notation f‚ÇÅ obtained via `f\1`.

Of course we could also want to define `f‚ÇÅ` as a function `‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñ§` (i.e. a sequence of integers), in which case we need to be more careful with the syntax. Here is a definition of such a function `f‚ÇÅ` that is fully precise, in which `n` is a term of type `‚Ñï` and `f‚ÇÅ(n)` (also denoted simply by `f‚ÇÅ n`, without a need for parentheses) is a term of type `‚Ñ§`. -/

def f‚ÇÅ (n : ‚Ñï) : ‚Ñ§ := - 2 * n + 5 

#check f‚ÇÅ
#check f‚ÇÅ 5
#eval f‚ÇÅ 5

/- Note that, if you print `f‚ÇÅ`, you will see that Lean introduces a symbol `‚Üë`, which is a *coercion*. meaning that the natural number `n : ‚Ñï` is *coerced* (forcely converted) into an integer `n : ‚Ñ§`, for which the term `- 2 * n + 5` makes sense. -/

-- #print f‚ÇÅ

/- If we declare `f‚ÇÅ` to be a function from `‚Ñ§` to `‚Ñ§` instead, then we do not need to indicate the type of `f‚ÇÅ n` in the definition, because for `n` of type `‚Ñ§`, the term `- 2 * n + 5` is automatically recognised as being of type `‚Ñ§`. -/

def f (n : ‚Ñ§) := - 2 * n + 5 

#check f
#check f 5
#eval f 5

/- ### Second definition of a function 

Next, we define the same function one more time, but in a slightly different way, emphasising in the declaration that `f‚ÇÇ` is a term of type `‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñ§`. This makes the first part of the defintion perhaps slightly more readable but then, after the `:=` sign, we have to introduce the term `n` using the `Œª` notation, which gives its name to [`Œª`-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Origin_of_the_Œª_symbol).

In the definition of `f‚ÇÇ`, I indicated the coercion symbol `‚Üë` explicitly, but it is not necessary (the symbol `‚Üë` is obtained by typing in `\u`, as in *up*). -/

def f‚ÇÇ : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñ§ := Œª n, -2 * ‚Üën + 5

#check f‚ÇÇ
#check f‚ÇÇ 5
#eval f‚ÇÇ 5

/- Using the command `#print` reveals that `f‚ÇÅ` and `f‚ÇÇ` are indeed the same function, and this is something we can actually prove. Since this is true *by definition*, we can prove it using the `refl` tactic. -/

-- #print f‚ÇÇ

def f1_and_f2_are_the_same_function : f‚ÇÅ = f‚ÇÇ := by { refl }

/- Note that `refl` can also be used to prove basic results such as the fact that the value of `f‚ÇÅ 5` is equal to `-5`. Since we have no need of a name for this result, we simply declare it as an `example`, which is similar to `def` but without having to give a name to what we are defining (this implies that we cannot perform a `#check` or a `#print` afterwards). -/

example : f‚ÇÅ 5 = -5 := by { refl }

/- ### Third definition of a function 

In this third option, we do not specify the type of `f‚ÇÉ` before the definition, so we have to be more detailed about the type of both `n` and `- 2 * n + 5` after the `:=` symbol. It is still the exact same function as `f‚ÇÅ` and `f‚ÇÇ`, though. -/

def f‚ÇÉ := Œª (n : ‚Ñï), (-2 * n + 5 : ‚Ñ§)

example : f‚ÇÇ = f‚ÇÉ := by { refl }
