/- Cardinality and bijection
----------------------------

We prove a result saying that, when there's a bijection between two sets,
then they have the same cardinal. Of course there's something similar in
mathlib, but it's formally different (the statement below does not use
a "function" in the sense of the underlying programming language, but in
ZF it would be a function, hence the name).

 such that the values vertex i for i ≤  len define a path in the 
 usual sense, while vertex i for i > len is ignored. It is more convenient
 than to have "vertex" defined on fin len and then having coercions everywhere.
