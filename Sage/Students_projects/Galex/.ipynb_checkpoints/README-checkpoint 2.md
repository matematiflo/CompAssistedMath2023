## How to run the project

To execute the project from a terminal, go into the project directory and run the command 

``` sage -python main.py ```

NumPy and Sage need to be installed for this.

## A side note on Google Slides and PDFs

The presentation has been made with google slides, which by default downloads it as a .pptx. \
When exporting to .pdf, the format gets slightly messed up.
Therefore, you might want to open the .pptx with google slides and look at it there for a better viewing experience.
